    "question": "Why do you need a nutrition label?",
    "answer": "If you’re in the food industry, you may be wondering who needs nutritional facts. There are a few reasons why you need a nutrition label on the food you’re selling. First, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires certain businesses to print nutrition labels on their products, such as those that sell $50,000 or more worth of food or $500,000 or more worth of food and non-food combined or companies with more than 10 full-time employees, selling more than 10,000 units annually.<br/><br/>Additionally, whole foods like fruits and vegetables are exempt from needing nutrition labels, foods with nutrient claims, such as “non-fat” or “gluten-free,” are required to have them.<br/><br/>Lastly, placing nutrition labels on your products is a great practice for your customers, as it allows them to better understand the nutrients and ingredients they’re consuming. Whether a consumer is looking for a particular allergy, such as dairy or gluten, or is curious about fat or sugar levels, nutrition labels help establish trust with your buyers. Using a nutrition facts label software like ReciPal can make this process easy by allowing you to input ingredients yourself or working with a labeling expert."
