    "question": "Why is accurate recipe pricing important?",
    "answer": "Accurate recipe pricing is important because customers want competitive pricing. With our ingredient cost calculator, you will be able to see beforehand where all of your overhead is going, enabling you to identify where you can cut costs in order to pass the savings onto your shoppers. You'll know exactly how much you will have to spend for each item, so you can plan out your projections far in advance.<br/><br/>While your customers are looking for a bargain, they also don't want cheap products. Your pricing not only tells them what your products are worth, it also tells them if they are worthwhile. By using our recipe cost calculator software, you will be able to identify and advertise the most premium ingredients you use. You may choose to cut back on lower quality ingredients and emphasize higher quality ones, advertise accordingly, and market your products as top-quality.<br/><br/>Of course, accurate recipe pricing is also a business concern. If you set low prices but don’t account for how much a food product actually costs to produce, this can potentially lead to cash flow problems and negatively impact your business. With our ingredient cost calculator, you can set competitive prices that still manage to generate a profit you’re satisfied with."
