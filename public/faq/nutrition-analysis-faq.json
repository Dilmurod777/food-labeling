    "question": "Can nutrition analysis software help me price my products?",
    "answer": "The main goal of our free recipe analysis software is to help you understand the nutritional content of any recipe. You can use this information to create nutrition labels and promote the nutritional benefits of your food. At the same time, this information can also help you price your products. For instance, if your food product boasts positive nutritional benefits when compared to competitors, this may impact your pricing strategy for that product.<br/><br/>We also offer software that allows you to accurately price your products and understand your costs. With ReciPal’s cloud-based recipe management software, you can view a recipe’s cost per package or batch and see what the main costs of your food products are. This allows you to price your products appropriately and make smarter business decisions."

    "question": "How does nutritional analysis work?",
    "answer": "ReciPal’s free nutritional analysis software saves you time and effort by providing you with access to an expansive USDA ingredient database with 10,000+ ingredients. To conduct a database nutritional analysis, the first step is to enter a product’s ingredients into our recipe analysis software. If an ingredient cannot be found in our database, you can create your own custom ingredient or obtain ingredient specification sheets from your supplier for the best results.<br/><br/>Once you have entered all of your ingredients, the next step is to set the amount of each ingredient and input the recipe yield and serving information. After these details have been added, our nutrition analysis software will automatically generate nutritional information and create an FDA-compliant nutrition label."

    "answer": "Whether you own a food business, run a restaurant, or manufacture food products, it’s important to know the nutritional value of the food items you produce.
