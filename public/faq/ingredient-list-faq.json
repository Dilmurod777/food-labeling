    "question": "How should ingredients be formatted on a product label?",
    "answer": "The FDA requires food manufacturers to list all product ingredients on the food label. The way you list your ingredients is also important.<br/><br/>Per FDA guidelines, ingredients must be listed according to how much of each ingredient is used, with the most predominant ingredients appearing at the top. So your label will start with the most predominant ingredient and then list the rest of the ingredients in descending order of the amount used.<br/><br/>If your product includes any color additives, they have to be named as well. According to the FDA, some food additives can simply be listed as “spices” or “artificial flavoring”. Generally, any food colors that aren’t FDA certified can just be named as “artificial colors.”"

    "question": "What is required in an ingredients list?",
    "answer": "To remain in compliance with the FDA, there are a few things food companies must include on their ingredients lists.<br/><br/>All of the ingredients should be listed after the word “Ingredients”. The list should be placed below the label’s nutritional panel or to the right of it.
