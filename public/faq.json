    "question": "What is on a nutrition label?",
    "answer": "Nutrition facts labels, also known as nutrition facts panels, vary by brand and product, but they make it easy to compare products to ensure consumers make the right food choices for themselves and their families. They display essential nutritional information, including calories, ingredients, macronutrients like carbs, fat, fiber, and protein, and micronutrients like vitamins per serving size."

    "question": "Why is a nutrition label important?",
    "answer": "Nutrition labels help consumers make informed decisions about the foods they buy at the store. These labels can affect an individual’s choice by helping them compare brands with similar products. This allows consumers to determine which foods are more nutritious by looking at calories, fats, sodium, sugar, protein, vitamins, and more. In addition, nutrition fact labels can save lives by listing the ingredients and allergens that may cause harmful reactions.\n\nFor businesses, nutrition fact labels are important because they must remain in compliance with regulatory bodies like the FDA and CFIA. Many companies are required to add nutritional labels to their food products, particularly if you plan to sell through retail or grow your business. Additionally, many consumers may avoid food items that don’t share this essential information, so creating accurate nutritional labels is a good business practice and can help you sell to customers that care about the nutrition of foods they consume."
